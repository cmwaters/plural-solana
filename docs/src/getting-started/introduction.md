# Introduction

**Plural** is a Solana-based governance toolkit for fostering inclusive institutions
and empowering collective ownership and decision making.

The ability for groups of people to come together, to form strong cohesive and
inclusive entities where everyone feels like a contributor to the betterment of
the group and a participant in that process has been the dominant recipe for
success throughout history. This notion is the central theme behind the
political philosophy of pluralism. The challenge with pluralistic systems most
notably lies when trying to scale to incorporating increasingly larger groups of
people. This challenge is exactly what Plural looks at tackling.
