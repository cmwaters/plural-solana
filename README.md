**Plural** is a Solana-based governance toolkit for fostering inclusing institutions and empowering both collective ownership and decision making. It allows for the creation of dynamic organizations and defined roles. The proposal process allows for all members to contribute with counter proposals. Members then vote and can change their vote on which of the proposals they prefer. Members signal preference using a token system rather than with simple weights. Each organization has a set of policies that can be modified to reward participation, change the election period, or even use different tallying policies like quadratic voting. Finally, Pproposals are an abstract array of instructions - which means they can be executed on other smart contracts like AMM's, on themselves or even on other DAO's.
